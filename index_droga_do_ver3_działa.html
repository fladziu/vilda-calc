      <strong>BMI</strong> (Body Mass Index) to wskaźnik masy ciała obliczany jako
      stosunek masy (kg) do kwadratu wzrostu (m²). Pomaga ocenić, czy Twoja masa
      ciała jest prawidłowa, z niedowagą, nadwagą czy otyłością.

      <strong>BMR</strong> (Basal Metabolic Rate) to ilość energii, jaką Twoje ciało zużywa w spoczynku
